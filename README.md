# Python module quickstart

## Introduction

This provides my skeleton for Python module development. It is based on a few approaches I have seen in the python community - I will dig out the links/references when updating this Readme to contain more detail. It:

+ Creates a conda environment containing `pytest` and `pip`.

+ Installs the module interactively into the conda environment (no more `sys.path.append`!).

+ Uses a clear mirror structure between code modules, tests and fixtures.

## Useage

Feel free to use this for your own work and help make the world a cleaner, more tested place!
